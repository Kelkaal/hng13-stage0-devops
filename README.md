### Description:
I forked the HNG Stage 0 DevOps repository and created a GitHub Actions workflow to automate deployment. Then, I set up and configured an NGINX web server on a cloud instance, edited the index.html file with my details, and placed it in /var/www/html/. The server was configured to run on port 80, serving my custom webpage publicly over the internet, showcasing my understanding of CI/CD, server setup, and web hosting best practices.
